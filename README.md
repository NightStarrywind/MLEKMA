MLEKMA（Empirical Kinetic Modeling Approach for Machine Learning）

Modern monitoring methods and big data analysis tools are the foundation of MLEKMA.

Machine learning models have a strong ability to restore and reline scenarios. Even when the emission scenario is reduced to zero emissions, the distribution of data can still maintain a very good shape.

The MLEKMA model can simulate the results of different emission scenarios. Traditional analytical tools rely on the chemical mechanisms involved, while MLEKMA depends on the amount of data. The larger the amount of data involved in training, the more reliable the model is.

We can use it to simulate the hourly and daily variation trends of ozone, which is mainly determined by the data you input into the model.
